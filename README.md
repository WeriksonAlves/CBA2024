## Title: A Gesture Recognition System for Robot Guidance Applications

The gesture classification system is a software application designed to analyze and interpret human gestures captured through images or videos. Its purpose is to identify and categorize specific gestures, such as hand movements or body poses, into predefined classes or categories. This system finds applications in various fields, including human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and motion analysis. By accurately recognizing and classifying gestures, the system enables intuitive and natural interaction between humans and machines, facilitating tasks such as controlling devices, interpreting sign language, and analyzing human behavior.
